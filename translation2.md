 Translation:
 Deianara, wife of Hercules, could not cross the large river, whose name was Evenus,
 and asked the centaur Nessus, who was the son of Ixion and Nubes, for help. 
 When Deianira was being taken through the river, Nessus himself wanted to rape her.
 When Hercules came to the river and Deianira begged for his help, he pierced Nessus with his arrows.
 As Nessus was dying, since he knew that the arrows had great power, He gave his own blood to Deienira 
 and he said that it was a love potion.
