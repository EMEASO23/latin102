C. Literary commentary
It is interesting that Hyginus starts off the sentences of this passage with the accusative direct object of the sentence 
(for example: *Diomedem Thraciae regem et equos quattuor *). This syntactic decision places a unique emphasis on the actions 
of Hercules and his power over his subjects. It is very interesting that Hyginus decided to use the ablative absolute for *Iove 
auditore* instead of just a participle. This helps to make the sentence concise while placing a unique emphasis on the role of 
Jupitor in the sentence.
