Gramatical Questions 
1. Identify the antecedent of cui, and its gender and number. Then explain what case cui is, and how it functions in the relative clause. (I.e., why is cui in this case?)

 - Antecedent = flumen
 - Neuter, Singular 
 - Cui is dative because it is acting as the indirect object of the relative clause “whose”

2. Identify the form of transire. Explain why you placed it in the clause you chose.

 - Transire is the present infinitive → I placed it in part of the main clause because it is attached to poterant which is an indicative verb

3. sublatam is from a verb that is a compound of sub plus a verb you should know very well. Identify the form of this participle (which for participles means: gender, case, number, tense voice). Find the dictionary entry for this word in the Lewis-Short’s Latin Dictionary, and give its URN here.

 - Masculine accusative singular passive

9. William Faulkner’s novel As I lay dying takes its title from an English translation of a single word in Odyssey 11.424. In Greek, where participles function very differently from English but similarly to Latin, that word is a present active participle. Suggest one or more possible translations of Faulkner’s title into Latin.
 
 - Moriens 



Translation:
Deianara, wife of Hercules, could not cross the large river, whose name was Evenus,
and asked the centaur Nessus, who was the son of Ixion and Nubes, for help. 
When Deianira was being taken through the river, Nessus himself wanted to rape her.
When Hercules came to the river and Deianira begged for his help, he pierced Nessus with his arrows.
As Nessus was dying, since he knew that the arrows had great power, He gave his own blood to Deienira 
and he said that it was a love potion.
